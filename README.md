# Electricity-and-Gas-Fraud-Detection

## Background \& Motivation 

The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a non-administrative company responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars (~86 mil SGD) due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.

**Motivation:**
- Electricity fraud is a significant issue in developing countries
- E.g. 20% of total electricity production in India is lost due to electricity fraud and theft
- Obstruct the economic growth of these developing countries - lose $58.7 billion per year due
to electricity theft
- By eliminating electricity and gas fraud, economic growth can improve and in turn reduce
poverty and increase quality of life.
